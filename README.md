# Collaborators

Collaborators is a GitHub bounty marketplace where maintainers fund issues in USDC and contributors earn rewards by shipping merged pull requests.

The app connects GitHub identity with a Solana wallet using Privy, tracks bounty submissions, and keeps bounty status in sync with GitHub events.

## What Is Implemented Today

- Public bounty board with `ACTIVE`, `SOLVED`, `EXPIRED`, and `CANCELLED` states.
- Contributor dashboard tabs: `Bounties`, `My Issues`, `Solved Issues`, `My Bounties`.
- Bounty creation tied to a GitHub issue (`owner/repo/issue_number`).
- PR submission flow for solvers (`/api/bounties/submissions`).
- GitHub webhook endpoint for issue and pull request events (`/api/github/webhook`).
- Repository bot-installation tracking for bounty automation checks.
- Privy-based authentication with GitHub OAuth and embedded Solana wallets.

## Bounty Lifecycle

### Maintainer flow

1. Log in and open an issue from the `My Issues` tab.
2. Create a bounty amount in USDC for that issue.
3. Configure GitHub webhook for the repository.
4. Review submitted PRs and merge a valid solution.
5. Mark payout complete to the solver wallet.

### Solver flow

1. Pick an `ACTIVE` bounty with an open GitHub issue.
2. Implement the fix and open a PR in the target repository.
3. Submit PR URL in the dashboard (`Submit Solution`).
4. Wait for maintainer review and merge.
5. Receive USDC payout from the bounty poster.

Note: Current schema and UI indicate payout transfer is maintainer-managed after solver verification.

## Webhook Setup (Required for Automation)

Configure a webhook in the target GitHub repository:

- Payload URL: `https://<your-domain>/api/github/webhook`
- Content type: `application/json`
- Events: `Issues` and `Pull requests`
- Secret: set `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your environment (recommended)

When a linked PR is merged, webhook handlers can mark matching submissions as approved and move the bounty to `SOLVED`.
